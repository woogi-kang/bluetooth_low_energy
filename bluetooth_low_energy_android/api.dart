/// this class are created with #getActivity, #getActivities, getBroadcast, and
/// getService; the returned object can be handed to other applications so that
/// they can perform the action you described on your behalf at a later time.
///
/// By giving a PendingIntent to another application, you are granting it the
/// right to perform the operation you have specified as if the other application
/// was yourself (with the same permissions and identity). As such, you should be
/// careful about how you build the PendingIntent: almost always, for example,
/// the base Intent you supply should have the component name explicitly set to
/// one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately sent there and nowhere
/// else.
///
/// A PendingIntent itself is simply a reference to a token maintained by the
/// system describing the original data used to retrieve it. This means that, even
/// if its owning application's process is killed, the PendingIntent itself will
/// remain usable from other processes that have been given it. If the creating
/// application later re-retrieves the same kind of PendingIntent (same operation,
/// same Intent action, data, categories, and components, and same flags), it will
/// receive a PendingIntent representing the same token if that is still valid,
/// and can thus call cancel to remove it.
///
/// Because of this behavior, it is important to know when two Intents are considered
/// to be the same for purposes of retrieving a PendingIntent. A common mistake
/// people make is to create multiple PendingIntent objects with Intents that only
/// vary in their "extra" contents, expecting to get a different PendingIntent
/// each time. This does not happen. The parts of the Intent that are used for
/// matching are the same ones defined by Intent.filterEquals. If you use two
/// Intent objects that are equivalent as per Intent.filterEquals, then you will
/// get the same PendingIntent for both of them.
///
/// There are two typical ways to deal with this.
///
/// If you truly need multiple distinct PendingIntent objects active at the same
/// time (such as to use as two notifications that are both shown at the same
/// time), then you will need to ensure there is something that is different about
/// them to associate them with different PendingIntents. This may be any of the
/// Intent attributes considered by Intent.filterEquals, or different request code
/// integers supplied to #getActivity, #getActivities, getBroadcast, or getService.
///
/// If you only need one PendingIntent active at a time for any of the Intents
/// you will use, then you can alternatively use the flags FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT or
/// FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT to either cancel or modify whatever current PendingIntent
/// is associated with the Intent you are supplying.
///
/// Also note that flags like FLAG_ONE_SHOT or FLAG_IMMUTABLE describe the
/// PendingIntent instance and thus, are used to identify it. Any calls to retrieve
/// or modify a PendingIntent created with these flags will also require these
/// flags to be supplied in conjunction with others. E.g. To retrieve an existing
/// PendingIntent created with FLAG_ONE_SHOT, both FLAG_ONE_SHOT and FLAG_NO_CREATE

/// A Handler allows you to send and process Message and Runnable objects associated
/// with a thread's MessageQueue. Each Handler instance is associated with a single
/// thread and that thread's message queue. When you create a new Handler it is
/// bound to a Looper. It will deliver messages and runnables to that Looper's
/// message queue and execute them on that Looper's thread.
///
/// There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and runnables
/// to be executed at some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue an action to
/// be performed on a different thread than your own.
///
/// Scheduling messages is accomplished with the post, postAtTime(java.lang.Runnable,long),
/// #postDelayed, sendEmptyMessage, sendMessage, sendMessageAtTime, and
/// sendMessageDelayed methods. The post versions allow you to enqueue Runnable
/// objects to be called by the message queue when they are received; the sendMessage
/// versions allow you to enqueue a Message object containing a bundle of data
/// that will be processed by the Handler's handleMessage method (requiring that
/// you implement a subclass of Handler).
///
/// When posting or sending to a Handler, you can either allow the item to be
/// processed as soon as the message queue is ready to do so, or specify a delay
/// before it gets processed or absolute time for it to be processed. The latter
/// two allow you to implement timeouts, ticks, and other timing-based behavior.
///
/// When a process is created for your application, its main thread is dedicated
/// to running a message queue that takes care of managing the top-level application
/// objects (activities, broadcast receivers, etc) and any windows they create.
/// You can create your own threads, and communicate back with the main application
/// thread through a Handler. This is done by calling the same post or sendMessage
/// methods as before, but from your new thread. The given Runnable or Message
/// will then be scheduled in the Handler's message queue and processed when
/// appropriate.
